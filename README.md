Hey there! 👋 I'm Zainab.
Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm on an exciting journey to becoming a Cloud Engineer, and this is where I showcase the skills, projects, and knowledge I've been building along the way. My passion for cloud technology began in 2023, right after I earned my bachelor's degree. Since then, I've been diving deep into the world of AWS and DevOps, learning, experimenting, and growing every step of the way.

🚀 A Little About Me
Cloud Explorer: My adventure started with AWS, where I’ve been learning how to design and implement cloud solutions that are scalable, secure, and efficient.
Hands-On Experience: I’ve rolled up my sleeves and gotten practical experience with services like EC2, S3, Lambda, and CloudFormation, while also automating workflows using Azure DevOps.
Always Learning: I’m actively pursuing certifications to back up my skills. [You can list specific certifications here.]
Problem-Solver in Training: I thrive on challenges, whether it’s optimizing a cloud infrastructure, setting up CI/CD pipelines, or automating tedious tasks.
🛠️ What I’m Working On
Here’s a sneak peek into the kind of projects you’ll find here:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Automating cloud setups using AWS CloudFormation and Terraform.
Serverless Solutions: Experimenting with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB for lightweight, scalable applications.
DevOps Automation: Creating pipelines with Azure DevOps, Dockerizing applications, and exploring Kubernetes for container orchestration.
Security & Reliability: Learning to design resilient architectures that prioritize security and fault tolerance.
🎯 My Vision
I believe the future belongs to those who can simplify complexity, and cloud technology is the perfect playground for that. My goal is to become a skilled cloud engineer who bridges the gap between development and operations, ensuring systems are efficient, scalable, and resilient.
